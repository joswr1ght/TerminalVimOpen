Applescript to open a file in iTerm2+vim for macOS.

Use this Applescript to build an app for macOS that you can use to launch
iTerm2 and open a file in `vim` from Finder.

Follow [these
directions](https://www.mattcrampton.com/blog/doubleclick_to_open_in_vim_on_osx/)
to get it setup on macOS with Automator. Preserved as a PDF here as well.
